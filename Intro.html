                    In short, the biggest attractive feature about the hobby is the "custom" in custom mechanical keyboards. Meaning that every part, not just pure looks, is fully customizable to your own tastes. The first piece, is the case, or the part where everything sits inside, including the pcb and switches, we will get to what that means. There are many kits available online that comes with everything you'll need but you can also purchase every part seperately. Cases can be made from many different materials, including different kinds of plastics, from ABS to Acrylics; you can also choose from different metals, there are options such as aluminum to brass and even nickel. The main thing you need to know about these different options is that it changes the sound and acoustics of your keyboard. Plastic tends to leak sound and have a very flat sound signature, while metal usually reflects most of the sound straight back to you and sounds almost "plinky." The image below shows the different components of a keyboard.&nbsp; <br>

                  Next up is the switches, these are the pieces that sit under the keycaps and register a keystroke. This is the "mechanical" in the name of the hobby, as inside of each switch are metal leaves that complete a current when depressed. There are way too many different kinds of switches to be able to fit into one section but the main categories are clicky, tactile and linear. Those 3 categories describe what the keystroke feel like. Clicky means that there will be an audible click when you press down, tactile means that there is no click but the bump in clickies is still there. Linear,  as the name implies, is a smooth, straight up and down stroke, there is no tactile event. There are even subcategories under each type of switch, depending on how loud, bumpy, or smooth a switch is. The type of switch that goes into your keyboard, is that hardest decision to make, this alone is its own rabbit hole. Switches can range from a variety of different plastics used in manufacturing to different kinds of springs and spring weights. This is also where most of the sound in your keyboard will be coming from.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>

                Lastly, there is the PCB. PCB stands for "Printed Circuit Board" and it's what the switches will be plugged or soldered into, there a wide variety of options from different sizes and formats. Some PCB's will only fit the big enter key that people in European countries use, while some will be able to fit every kind of layout imaginable. There are even options that will let you have more than one space bar. Typically this is something that only people who have been in the hobby will mess around with because it requires a solid understanding of how to code a PCB, it can be quite easy to accidentally brick the board and not have it work. Almost all keyboard kits will come with a preprogrammed PCB that is hotswap. Hotswap means that there is no soldering required to fit in the switches and it's plug and play. Typically PCB's are made from a type of fiberglass and unless you purchase a higher end PCB, they may not have a huge impact on sound. What does have a giant impact on sound however, is how they are mounted into the case, and this will vary from kit to kit. PCB's can either be directly screwed down into the case, or they could even be sandwiched in between the top and bottom half of the case without using any screws. The keyboard pictured in the home page actually uses no screws and the PCB is pressure fit by a large rubber band that wraps around the board, it slides down into the case which is one solid block of casted aluminum.  <br>

                  Next up is the switches, these are the pieces that sit under the keycaps and register a keystroke. This is the "mechanical" in the name of the hobby, as inside of each switch are metal leaves that complete a current when depressed. There are way too many different kinds of switches to be able to fit into one section but the main categories are clicky, tactile and linear. Those 3 categories describe what the keystroke feel like. Clicky means that there will be an audible click when you press down, tactile means that there is no click but the bump in clickies is still there. Linear,  as the name implies, is a smooth, straight up and down stroke, there is no tactile event. There are even subcategories under each type of switch, depending on how loud, bumpy, or smooth a switch is. The type of switch that goes into your keyboard, is that hardest decision to make, this alone is its own rabbit hole. Switches can range from a variety of different plastics used in manufacturing to different kinds of springs and spring weights. This is also where most of the sound in your keyboard will be coming from.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>

                Lastly, there is the PCB. PCB stands for "Printed Circuit Board" and it's what the switches will be plugged or soldered into, there a wide variety of options from different sizes and formats. Some PCB's will only fit the big enter key that people in European countries use, while some will be able to fit every kind of layout imaginable. There are even options that will let you have more than one space bar. Typically this is something that only people who have been in the hobby will mess around with because it requires a solid understanding of how to code a PCB, it can be quite easy to accidentally brick the board and not have it work. Almost all keyboard kits will come with a preprogrammed PCB that is hotswap. Hotswap means that there is no soldering required to fit in the switches and it's plug and play. Typically PCB's are made from a type of fiberglass and unless you purchase a higher end PCB, they may not have a huge impact on sound. What does have a giant impact on sound however, is how they are mounted into the case, and this will vary from kit to kit. PCB's can either be directly screwed down into the case, or they could even be sandwiched in between the top and bottom half of the case without using any screws. The keyboard pictured in the home page actually uses no screws and the PCB is pressure fit by a large rubber band that wraps around the board, it slides down into the case which is one solid block of casted aluminum.  <br>
